**Quality Assurance Protocols:**
- Rigorous testing protocols including clinical validation studies
- Performance benchmarks against standard of care
- Continuous monitoring of system performance and safety
- Rapid response protocols for identified safety issues

### 4.2 Human Oversight and Control

**Clinical Oversight Requirements:**
- AI systems must support, not replace, clinical judgment
- Healthcare providers maintain final decision-making authority
- Clear escalation procedures for uncertain or high-risk AI recommendations
- Mandatory human review for certain types of AI-generated decisions

**Emergency Protocols:**
- Immediate AI system shutdown capabilities for safety concerns
- Fallback procedures when AI systems are unavailable
- Clear communication protocols for AI system failures
- Regular emergency response drills and training
