## 🔧 Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- pip package manager
- Basic understanding of Python and data science

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd week7

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv ai_ethics_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
ai_ethics_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source ai_ethics_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python -c "import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn; print('All packages installed successfully!')"
```

### Step 3: Run the Assignment

#### Option A: Python Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the main COMPAS audit script
python compas_audit.py
```

#### Option B: Jupyter Notebook
```bash
# Install Jupyter if not already installed
pip install jupyter

# Launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook compas_audit_simple.ipynb
```

### Step 4: Review Results
1. **Console Output**: Comprehensive bias analysis and fairness metrics
2. **Generated Files**: 
   - `compas_bias_analysis.png` - Bias analysis visualizations
   - `confusion_matrix.png` - Model performance visualization
3. **Documentation**: All markdown files contain complete assignment solutions

## 📊 What You'll See

### Console Output Example
```
COMPAS Dataset Bias Audit
==================================================
Creating sample data for demonstration...
Sample data created with simulated racial bias.
Preprocessed data shape: (1000, 13)

=== BIAS ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===
African-American defendants: 421 total
Caucasian defendants: 380 total

High Risk Rate - African-American: 0.452
High Risk Rate - Caucasian: 0.237
Disparity Ratio: 1.91

=== MANUAL FAIRNESS CALCULATIONS ===
Statistical Parity Difference: 0.2150
Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.0771
Disparate Impact Ratio: 1.9067

=== COMPREHENSIVE BIAS AUDIT REPORT ===
[Detailed analysis and recommendations...]
```

### Generated Visualizations
- **Risk Score Distribution by Race**: Shows bias in scoring
- **Recidivism Rate by Race**: Disparities in outcomes
- **Risk Score vs Recidivism**: Model performance analysis
- **High Risk Classification**: Bias in risk categorization

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Package Installation Errors
```bash
# Try upgrading pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install packages individually if needed
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

#### 2. AI Fairness 360 Installation Issues
```bash
# If aif360 fails to install, the script will use manual calculations
# This is handled gracefully in the code
```

#### 3. Visualization Display Issues
```bash
# If plots don't display, check that matplotlib backend is working
python -c "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.plot([1,2,3]); plt.show()"
```

#### 4. Permission Errors
```bash
# On Windows, run PowerShell as Administrator
# On macOS/Linux, use sudo if necessary
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
